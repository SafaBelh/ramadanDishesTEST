<!-- Notes -->
ðŸ“Œ For this Challenge , i put my focus on making the code run first -- Like i didn't really    focus so good  on code optimization techniques ðŸ˜‘ 

ðŸ“Œ For the Second EndPoint i went with a random method (is the closet way i found as we are limited to only one query param (day) ^^ )

ðŸ“Œ In Both Suggest & CookTime Routes i went for Same Logic -- The Normal case is to create a function to handle reusable Logic -- i did that in UtiLs Folder but i fell in a Syntax Bug that i didn't Understand ðŸ˜‘ ( Missing  ) after ..... ) nd no missing ) was found ! - this worked only in Suggest Router
